## Welcome, welcome! ☺️

My name is Andrea and I am currently studying Data Engineering at [Becode](https://becode.org/). 😄

As a Data Engineering student, organizing and structuring data is my jam 🗃️!

I also really enjoy Data Analysis because I am too curious. I want to see what the data is talking about🧐 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning PowerBi, Azure and Data Modeling
- 🔭 I’m working on a pipeline to extract the pollen 🌳 data from [PDFs](https://airallergy.sciensano.be/newsletters/2024) and hopefully transform it into a pretty dashboard. The available online radars are too generic and non interactive for my ~~taste~~ nose 🤧
- 📫 Do you have an internship in Data Engineering and/or Analysis here in Belgium? Reach out to me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-haritcalde/)!
